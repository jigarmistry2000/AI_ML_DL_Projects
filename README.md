# AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a **professional portfolio**, not a tutorial dump and not a collection of half-baked notebooks copied from Medium. It contains end-to-end implementations of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning projects with a focus on **problem formulation, data handling, model design, evaluation, and reproducibility**.

---

## Repository Objectives

* Demonstrate **practical ML/DL skills**, not just theory
* Show ability to work with **real-world, imperfect data**
* Write **clean, modular, and reproducible code**

---

## Project Categories

### Machine Learning

* Supervised learning (classification, regression)
* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
* Feature engineering and selection
* Model comparison and benchmarking

### Deep Learning

* Neural networks from scratch and with frameworks
* CNNs for image-based tasks
* RNNs / LSTMs / Transformers for sequence data
* Transfer learning and fine-tuning

### Applied AI

* End-to-end pipelines
* Model deployment–ready code structures
* Performance vs. complexity trade-off analysis

├── Projects/          # AI ML Projects
└── README.md          # You are here
```

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Languages**: Python
* **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch / TensorFlow (project-dependent)
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Experiment Tracking**: Manual or framework-based (clearly documented per project)

---

## Project Standards

Every serious project in this repository follows these rules:

* Clear problem statement
* Explicit assumptions and constraints
* Proper train/validation/test splits
* Baseline models before complex ones
* Justification for model choice
* Honest evaluation (no metric cheating)
* Reproducible results

---

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Navigate to a project directory
5. Read the project-specific README before touching the code

---

## Disclaimer

This repository reflects **professional experimentation and learning**, not production systems. Code quality improves over time as projects evolve. Expect refactoring. Expect opinions. Expect trade-offs.
